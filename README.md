My graphite localized install.  That means each cap deploy installs a
localized Graphite with Python and dependancies into the release
directory.

## TODO:
* Warn when system packages are not installed.
* Shared database between releases, maybe MySQL.
* Carbon collection server.
* [StatsD](https://github.com/etsy/statsd) stats aggregator.
* [Diamond](http://opensource.brightcove.com/project/Diamond/) system
* stats collector.
